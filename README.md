## 🧠 Rules of the Game

Conway's Game of Life is a zero-player game that evolves based on its initial state. It follows these four rules:

1. 💀 Any **live** cell with **fewer than two** live neighbours **dies** (underpopulation).
2. 🟢 Any **live** cell with **two or three** live neighbours **lives** on to the next generation.
3. ☠️ Any **live** cell with **more than three** live neighbours **dies** (overpopulation).
4. 🌱 Any **dead** cell with **exactly three** live neighbours **becomes alive** (reproduction).
